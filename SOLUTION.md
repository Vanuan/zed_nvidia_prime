# GPU Device Loss Handling in Zed

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Addressing Concerns and the Context ü§î (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

### 1.1 Current Handling in Zed üîÑ

Currently, Zed uses Blade‚Äôs `wait_for` API to synchronize GPU operations. This API waits for a synchronization point to be reached within a specified timeout. However, if `wait_for` hangs (for example, due to GPU device loss), Zed enters an infinite loop, repeatedly checking for the synchronization point. This makes the application unresponsive and leaves users unable to continue their work. Additionally, the current approach lacks proper error handling and user feedback, resulting in a poor user experience. Users are left frustrated and confused, with no indication of what went wrong or how to recover.

The current implementation is problematic for several reasons:
1. It relies on timeouts to detect GPU device loss, which is unreliable. A long wait could indicate either a busy GPU or a truly stuck device, and there is no way to distinguish between the two.
2. The infinite loop used to check for recovery exacerbates the problem, making the application unresponsive and wasting system resources.
3. The lack of error reporting and user feedback leaves users in the dark, unable to understand or resolve the issue. This creates a frustrating experience and undermines trust in the application.

Addressing these issues is critical to improving Zed‚Äôs robustness and user experience.

### 1.2 Suspend/Resume Events ‚è∏Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Operating systems provide mechanisms to notify applications about suspend/resume events. For example:
- On Windows, applications can listen for `WM_POWERBROADCAST` messages.
- On macOS, applications can register for `NSWorkspaceWillSleepNotification`.
- On Linux, applications can use systemd inhibitors to delay suspend until critical operations are complete.

These events allow applications to prepare for system suspension by saving data, freeing resources, or reinitializing the GPU. While this approach works for handling suspend/resume scenarios, it is not a complete solution for GPU device loss.

Suspend/resume events alone are insufficient for handling GPU device loss for several reasons:
1. **Device Loss Without Suspend**: GPU device loss can occur due to driver crashes, overheating, or other hardware/software issues, even without a suspend/resume event. Relying solely on suspend/resume notifications would miss these cases.
2. **Suspend Without Device Loss**: Some systems may suspend and resume without losing the GPU device. In such cases, suspend/resume events would trigger unnecessary recovery logic, wasting resources and potentially disrupting the user experience.
3. **Heuristic Timeouts Are Unreliable**: The current approach of using timeouts to detect GPU hangs is problematic because:
   - A long wait could indicate either a busy GPU or a truly stuck device. Without additional context, it is impossible to distinguish between the two.
   - Infinite loops (e.g., `while !wait_for {}`) exacerbate the problem by consuming CPU resources and making the application unresponsive.

In summary, suspend/resume events are a useful tool for handling specific scenarios, but they are not a comprehensive solution for GPU device loss. A more robust approach is needed to detect and handle device loss reliably, regardless of the cause.

### 1.3 Blade‚Äôs Role üõ†Ô∏è

#### 1.3.1 Why Blade Is Needed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Blade is designed as a low-level GPU abstraction layer, providing a unified interface for Vulkan, Metal, and GLES. This makes it the ideal place to handle GPU-specific issues like device loss. Blade is uniquely positioned to detect and report device loss because it interacts directly with the GPU and understands the intricacies of each backend. By handling device loss at the Blade level, we ensure that applications like Zed can focus on higher-level logic without worrying about low-level GPU errors.

#### 1.3.2 Why Device Loss Is Blade's, Not Application Concern üéÆ

GPU device loss is a low-level issue that applications like Zed should not need to handle directly. It is a GPU-specific problem that requires knowledge of the underlying API (e.g., Vulkan‚Äôs `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`, Metal‚Äôs `MTLCommandBufferStatusError`, or GLES‚Äôs `GL_WAIT_FAILED`). Blade, as the abstraction layer, is best equipped to detect these errors and provide utilities for recovery. By handling device loss in Blade, we ensure cross-platform consistency and simplify the development of applications like Zed, which can rely on Blade to manage GPU errors gracefully.

<summary><strong>2. Proper Approach ‚úÖ (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

### 2.1 Blade's Responsibility üõ°Ô∏è

#### 2.1.1 Error Detection üîç

Blade should detect unrecoverable errors, such as `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` in Vulkan, `MTLCommandBufferStatusError` in Metal, or `GL_WAIT_FAILED` in GLES. These errors indicate that the GPU device has been lost and cannot be recovered without reinitialization. By detecting these errors directly, Blade ensures that GPU device loss is identified reliably, without relying on unreliable timeouts or suspend/resume events. This allows applications to respond to device loss proactively, rather than waiting indefinitely for a stuck GPU to recover.

#### 2.1.2 Error Reporting üì¢

Blade should report errors to the application through a clear and expressive API. For example, the `wait_for` API should return `Result<bool, BladeError>`, where:
- **`Ok(true)`**: The operation completed successfully.
- **`Ok(false)`**: The operation is still pending (keep trying).
- **`Err(BladeError)`**: The GPU is in an unrecoverable state (e.g., device lost, driver crashed).

This design is simple and aligns with Rust‚Äôs error handling patterns. It avoids introducing complex enums like `SyncStatus` while still providing clear semantics.

#### 2.1.3 Recovery Utilities üõ†Ô∏è

Blade should provide utilities for freeing GPU resources and reinitializing the device. For example:
- `destroy_device()`: Safely frees resources tied to the lost device, such as command buffers, textures, and pipelines.
- `reinitialize_device()`: Recreates the GPU device and critical resources, such as swapchains and command pools.

These utilities simplify the recovery process for applications, ensuring that they can handle GPU device loss gracefully without needing to implement platform-specific logic. By providing these tools, Blade empowers applications to recover from errors quickly and maintain a seamless user experience.

### 2.2 Application (Zed/gpui) Responsibility üñ•Ô∏è

#### 2.2.1 Application-Specific Handling üõ†Ô∏è

When Blade returns `Err(BladeError)`, Zed should:
1. **Save Unsaved Data**: Persist any unsaved data to a crash file.
2. **Show a Notification**: Use a "best effort" approach to display a desktop notification.
3. **Log the Error**: Log the error for diagnostics and crash reporting.
4. **Exit Gracefully**: Exit the application without attempting to restart automatically (to avoid infinite loops).

This ensures that users are informed about issues, even in unstable states, while gracefully degrading to logging if notifications fail.

#### 2.2.2 User Feedback üí¨

Zed should provide clear and actionable feedback to users when a GPU error occurs. This includes:
- **A Message**: Display a user-friendly message, such as ‚ÄúZed encountered a GPU error and has exited. Your work has been saved.‚Äù
- **Option to Submit Debug Information**: Offer users the option to submit debug information for telemetry and diagnostics.

Providing this feedback improves the user experience by making errors transparent and giving users a sense of control. It also helps developers gather valuable data to diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.

### 2.3 Analysis of the Proper Approach üìä

#### 2.3.1 Reliable Error Detection üîç

Blade‚Äôs ability to detect and report unrecoverable errors directly is a cornerstone of the **Proper Approach**. By identifying issues like `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`, `MTLCommandBufferStatusError`, or `GL_WAIT_FAILED`, Blade avoids unreliable heuristics such as timeouts or suspend/resume events. This ensures that errors are caught early and accurately, allowing applications to respond proactively rather than waiting indefinitely for a stuck GPU to recover.

#### 2.3.2 Graceful Recovery üîÑ

The **Proper Approach** divides recovery responsibilities between **Blade** and **Zed** to ensure a seamless experience. **Blade** detects and reports GPU errors (e.g., `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`) and provides low-level utilities for freeing resources and reinitializing the GPU. **Zed** handles user-facing tasks, such as saving unsaved data to a crash file and providing clear feedback (e.g., ‚ÄúZed encountered a GPU error and has exited.‚Äù). This division ensures robust error handling, consistent cross-platform experience, and re-usability beyond Zed.

#### 2.3.3 User Feedback üí¨

Clear and actionable feedback is a key component of the **Proper Approach**. When a GPU error occurs, applications like Zed can inform users with a message such as, ‚ÄúZed encountered a GPU error and has exited. Your work has been saved.‚Äù This transparency reassures users that their data is safe and the application is recovering. Additionally, offering users the option to submit debug information for telemetry and diagnostics helps developers identify and fix issues, improving the application‚Äôs stability over time.

#### 2.3.4 Cross-Platform Consistency üåç

Blade‚Äôs abstraction ensures that the **Proper Approach** works consistently across Vulkan, Metal, and GLES. By handling GPU device loss at the Blade level, applications like Zed can rely on a unified API for error detection, reporting, and recovery. This simplifies development and ensures a consistent experience for users, regardless of their platform or backend.

### 3.1 Blade's Responsibility to Report Unrecoverable Error to Zed üì¢

Blade plays a critical role in detecting and reporting unrecoverable GPU errors, such as `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` in Vulkan, `MTLCommandBufferStatusError` in Metal, or `GL_WAIT_FAILED` in GLES. These errors indicate that the GPU device has been lost and cannot be recovered without reinitialization. Blade‚Äôs responsibility is to detect these errors as they occur and report them to Zed through a clear and expressive API, such as the `Result<bool, BladeError>` return type.

By reporting errors explicitly, Blade ensures that Zed is aware of the issue and can take appropriate action. This allows Zed to handle GPU device loss proactively, whether by saving unsaved data, exiting gracefully, or providing feedback to the user. Blade‚Äôs error reporting mechanism is essential for enabling Zed to recover gracefully and maintain a seamless user experience, even in the face of GPU errors.

### 3.2 Radical Recovery Approach (Chrome-Like) üöÄ
