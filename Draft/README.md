# Implementing Vulkan Device Loss Handling in Zed

Here's a Rust implementation that addresses the key challenges of Vulkan device loss during suspend/resume cycles on Linux.

## Core Components

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Blade**
   - Modifies Blade's `wait_for` API to return a `Result<bool, BladeError>` instead of just a boolean
   - Properly propagates Vulkan's `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` as a specific error type
   - Avoids the infinite loop problem mentioned in the Zed document

2. **D-Bus Power Signal Integration**
   - Uses the `zbus` crate to connect to systemd's power management signals
   - Handles "PrepareForSleep" events to save state before suspend
   - Flags device for recreation upon system resume

3. **Device Health Checking**
   - Implements a proactive `check_health()` method to detect device loss without relying on timeouts
   - Creates a test fence to verify device functionality
   - Can be called at the beginning of each frame render

4. **State Preservation**
   - Implements serializable application state for saving work
   - Creates emergency crash saves when device loss is detected
   - Provides mechanisms to restore state after device recreation

5. **Complete Device Recreation**
   - Provides a clean way to destroy and recreate the entire Vulkan stack
   - Properly cleans up resources before recreation
   - Handles the complete teardown and rebuild required by Vulkan

## Integration with Zed's Architecture

This implementation respects Zed's architecture by:

1. Following Rust idioms and error handling patterns
2. Working with Blade's abstraction layer rather than directly with Vulkan
3. Providing integration points with GPUI's rendering system
4. Using appropriate Rust crates (zbus, serde, thiserror) that align with Zed's dependencies

The solution follows the "Proper Approach" outlined in the Zed document, ensuring that device loss is detected reliably, application state is preserved, and users are properly notified of issues.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the implementation in more detail?
